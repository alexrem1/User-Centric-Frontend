<h2>Hammer and Nails</h2>
<p>Project 1: User-Centric Frontend Development - Code Institute
My gym website is aimed at attracting and retaining members via benefits focus, member segmentation, newsletters, availability on different social media platforms as well as information about the gym and its procedures. The website highlights its facilities, pricing (membership and offers), safety and security, our location and contact details and why a prospective member should choose hammer and nails.

<h2>UX</h2>
<p>My website design, for prospective members, is intended to give educational information that’ll attract them to join the gym based on the available data. For example a prospective member may want to find out how far the gym is or if they believe the gym is truly safe. However, current members use information on the website, classes for example, actively participate in receiving voluntary information about the gym with the aim of member retention.
With the use of gym related information such as, facilities, pricing (membership and offers), safety and security, our location and contact details, newsletters and why a prospective member should choose hammer and nails, users of the website can make informed decisions on whether they wish to join the gym, stay or leave. As a user type, I want to perform an action, so that I can achieve a goal.
<br>
I also wanted to make sure users would stay engaged with the use of complimentary dark and light tones of colour for an aesthetically pleasing visit to the website.</p>

<h2>Features</h2>
<p>This site has features contained within Bootstrap such as a navbar, forms and modals all with the intention of engaging with current and prospective members.</p>

<h2>Existing Features</h2>
	<li>Members Area form – allows current members to view and access information and content which was originally restricted by having them enter their credentials</li>
	<li>Navbar – allows users to easily navigate their way through the site </li>
	<li>Modals – makes users aware of very specific information based off of a form, in this sites case. By filling out the form an informational box will appear</li>
	<li>Lists – allows users to easily read the content</li>
<h2>Features Left to Implement</h2>
<li>In the future I would to create accounts associated to my footer logo social media platforms so users can find out more about the gym.</li>
<h2>Technologies Used</h2>
<li>	HTML: to structure and layout web content</li>
	<li>CSS: it is fundamental to web design and how it looks</li>
	<li>Bootstrap (4.3.1): it gives me a solid foundation of which I can build upon</li>

<h2>Testing</h2>
<p>My project portrayed the intended outcome of attracting prospective members and retaining current members. 
<br>Prospective members can learn about what the gym has to offer by browsing the site. On the home page there’s awards received, what current offers are available, our contact, location and opening hours details. Information detailing how to receive one free day pass is at the bottom of the page if they were interested in joining but wanted to be shown around first. Really important is our newsletter where you receive up to date developments about the gym such as new products, special promotional offers and our company's participation in exhibitions and conferences. Although my icons in the footer to the gym’s social media aren’t clickable at the moment, it is still a feature I will add in the future.
When browsing through the memberships and offers page they are given a brief reason as to why to join Hammer and Nails as well as view the features of the two different memberships and offers. They can view all the different kinds of classes I have to offer as well as all the facilities the gym contains.
<br>
All of this information helps prospective members make an informed decision based on the information on the page.
<br>
Current members regularly come back to the page to either check for new offers or to login into the website for my personalised information, to book classes, to update or view any goals they may have added to their profile etc and even see if they have been selected as a winner in raffle prizes.
<br>
If you try to submit the contact form with an invalid email address, there will be an error saying the email address you entered is not in line with what it wants because the 'required' attribute is added to the 'email’ field. Meaning the form will not submit until the field is valid. After that a modal will pop up further detailing is to be for educational purposes.
<br>
A modal will also pop up when trying to log in, click the join now button and opening hours and times buttons.
<br>
With a mobile first design approach, everything was scaled upwards. Some information was left in its simplistic mobile nature covering a whole column whilst other information started to take up 3rds and 4ths of the screen. A notable mention was the navigation bar, when in mobile it’s a simple abbreviation of my gym and a menu button that drops down, however when leaving its media query, it expands into a full navigation bar with the message only being seen in desktop mode. Another notable mention was the contact us section in the marketing section, as it was pushing the screen width out due to its content, I made so that can be seen on extra small screens and again on extra large screens as it was causing a problem for the small and large screens
<br>
This site was tested across multiple browsers (Chrome, Safari, Internet Explorer) and on multiple mobile devices (iPhone 6, 7, 8: Chrome and Safari, iPad, iPad Pro, Samsung Galaxy) to ensure compatibility and responsiveness.
<br>
When testing for Internet Explorer I found that it didn’t load my colours. This was because IE didn’t accept an 8-digit format, #cccc4537 for example, so I changed it to an RGBA code and everything worked smoothly. </p>
<h2>Deployment</h2>
<p>I deployed my site to Github pages directly from the master branch. The deployed site will update automatically upon new commits to said branch. In order for the site to deploy correctly on GitHub pages, the landing page has been named index.html.</p>
To run locally, you can clone this repository directly into the editor of your choice by pasting "git clone https://github.com/alexrem1/User-Centric-Frontend.git" into your terminal. To cut ties with this GitHub repository, type "git remote rm origin" into the terminal.
